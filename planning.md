## Alternative Ideas

- We can use little buttons at the top of the reviews as categories kinda like [IGN](https://www.ign.com/ca)
- each list of review in the homepage can have the same styling as [Medium](https://medium.com/) or we can just stick with [IGN](https://www.ign.com/ca) styling
- navigation bar can have something similar to [The Huffington Post](https://www.huffpost.com/) but doesn't need to
